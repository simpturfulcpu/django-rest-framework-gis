  Goodbye, Things: The New Japanese Minimalism     
Minimalism is a lifestyle in which you reduce your possessions to the absolute minimum you need. It is a way of living with less clutter, less stress, and more freedom. But what does minimalism look like in Japan, a country known for its culture of consumerism, convenience, and kawaii (cute) things?
     
In his best-selling book **Goodbye, Things: The New Japanese Minimalism**, Fumio Sasaki shares his personal journey of becoming a minimalist and how it changed his life for the better. Sasaki was once a typical salaryman who lived in a cramped apartment filled with books, CDs, DVDs, gadgets, and clothes. He was unhappy, insecure, and constantly comparing himself to others. One day, he decided to get rid of everything he didn't absolutely need and say goodbye to his things. The benefits were instantaneous and remarkable: without all his "stuff", Sasaki gained true freedom, peace of mind, and appreciation for the present moment.
